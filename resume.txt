EXPERIENCE
Software Engineer
Cinnova Technologies
04/2023 - Present
Pakistan
US based company having 1 branch in Pakistan focused on new innovations and solving clients problems
• At Tab Services, I built a scalable e-filing platform for IRS forms like 1099NEC, 1099INT, 1099MISC and etc, handling over 1 million
records per client. The challenge was optimizing large data validation, PDF generation, and XML file creation under strict IRS
compliance. I used Django with multiprocessing, signals, and async task queues (Celery) for backend efficiency, and React.js with
Jotai and TanStack Router for a role-based, high-performance frontend. This reduced processing time by 80%, improved system
reliability, and enabled seamless A2A submissions, driving a 60% boost in client onboarding.
• Parking Management system managed heavy data on properties, residents, and parking spaces, making the frontend complex and
slow. I optimized the React.js app with lazy loading, code splitting, and virtualization, reducing load times and ensuring smooth
performance.
• Engineered Azure-based modules for data analysis, printing operations, and role-based permissions, ensuring seamless operation
and user management

Cyber Hawk
07/2022 - 04/2023
A technology company specializing in full-stack web development
• At Cyber Hawk System the challenge was handling inconsistent and high-frequency sensor data streams without UI lag or data loss.
I implemented efficient data batching and debounce logic in the backend, along with WebSocket integration on the frontend for
real-time updates. This reduced API load by 85% and improved dashboard responsiveness, providing a smooth live monitoring
experience.
• Implemented granular system for secure user access and permissions

Active/Passive Sensors: Devices (Active: Radar, Passive: Thermistor) publish measurements via MQTT to AWS IoT Core.
AWS Lambda: The IoT Rule triggers a Lambda function written in Python. This function acts as the secure intermediary, receiving the sensor data.
Developed the Django application to manage data models, ensuring efficient, low-latency persistence of sensor readings using Django WebSockets.
